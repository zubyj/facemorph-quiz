Information Collection and Use

The image uploaded by the user is temporarily stored for the purpose of morphing the image. The final morphed image is also stored on the server, so the link to the morphed image remains valid.

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

We do not explicitly use cookies.


Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning.


There are no links to other sites.

Our services do not target anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.

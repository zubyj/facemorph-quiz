The FaceMorph Quiz app, provided by Zohaib Javed at no cost, is intended for use "as is."
This page informs visitors about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for users of FaceMorph Quiz.
By choosing to use FaceMorph Quiz, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in  ourTerms and Conditions, which are accessible at FaceMorph Quiz unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend that you review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page and will be effective as of the date specified.


Information Collection and Use

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish core app functionality.
The image uploaded by the user is temporarily stored for the purpose of morphing the image. 
The final morphed image is also stored on the server, so the link to the morphed image remains valid.
The images uploaded to the server are automatically deleted after 24 hours. 
Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.
We may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.


Analytics

We use Firebase Analytics, a third-party analytics tool provided by Google, to track the number of morph requests. Firebase Analytics collects data such as your device information, usage data, and user demographics. This information is used to improve the app's performance and to provide better services to our users.
Firebase Analytics is subject to Google's privacy policy, which you can find here: https://policies.google.com/privacy. We confirm that Google provides the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this privacy policy and required by the iOS app guidelines.
By using the app, you consent to the collection and use of your data by Firebase Analytics in accordance with their privacy policy and this privacy policy.
If you have any questions or concerns about how we use Firebase Analytics, please do not hesitate to contact us at zubydevelops@gmail.com.


Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning.
Our services do not target anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

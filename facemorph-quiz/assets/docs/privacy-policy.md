## Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

Our app, FaceMorph Quiz, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use FaceMorph Quiz and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. By using FaceMorph Quiz, you consent to our privacy policy.

**Data Collection**

The user must upload an image of their face for the app to work. The uploaded image is temporarily stored on our server to morph the image. The final morphed image is also temporarily stored on our server to display to users. After 24 hours, both the image uploaded by the user and the final morphed image are deleted from the server. This is to protect the privacy of our users.

**Data shared with third parties**

Firebase Analytics is the only third-party tool used to track the number of images uploaded by the user. No additional information is tracked. All communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

**Data retention and deletion policies**

The retention period for face data is 24 hours. After this period, your face data is permanently deleted from our servers. You can also request to delete your data before the retention period is up. To achieve this, contact us below.

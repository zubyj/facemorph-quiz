# Privacy Policy

## Data collected

- We temporarily store the image uploaded by the user for the morpher to function.

-  The final morphed image is also stored on the server so the image can be displayed in the game. 

-  Both the uploaded image and the morphed image are periodically deleted (every 24 hours) from the server.

-  This is to protect the privacy of the users. 

## Third-party data sharing

- Images (uploaded and morphed) are never shared with any third parties whatsoever. 

- The only third party data app used is Firebase Analytics which is used on our server to simply track the number of upload & morph requests. Nothing else is collected.

## Security

- To request to delete your uploaded and/or morphed image before the 24 hour rentention period, our contact information is listed below.

- By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.
